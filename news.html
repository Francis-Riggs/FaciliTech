                <h2>How Elevation SRS is Helping Apartment Managers Succeed</h2>
                <time>December 11, 2019</time>
                <p>Apartment maintenance can be a hectic business. Maintenance managers at large apartment complexes often
                encounter numerous difficulties integrating customer service requests into their workflow. With the wide
                variety of different maintenance projects that demand attention, itâ€™s easy for work orders to slip through
                the cracks and remain unnoticed. Elevation SRS helps apartment managers reduce work order backlogs by
                automatically notifying managers about unresolved service requests in the system. By ensuring that no work
                order is forgotten, Elevation SRS improves customer satisfaction and maintenance efficiency.</p>

                <h2>Why Customers Love Elevation SRS</h2>
                <time>November 19, 2019</time>
                <p>As all facilities managers know, it is critical to know about problems as soon as they occur. As such,
                it's important that customers can submit work orders as easily and descriptively as possible. Unfortunately,
                customers are often (and understandably) frustrated by the outdated, inflexible interfaces that often accompany
                work order systems. Elevation SRS removes these frustrations by making service requests as simple and accessible
                as possible. Customers can easily navigate Elevation's user interface from practically any device, which
                minimizes the obstacles between customers and customer service. Thanks to its ease of use, Elevation
                ultimately makes response times faster and customers happier.</p>

                <h2>Elevation SRS 1.15 Update Has Been Released</h2>
                <time>October 7, 2019</time>
                <p>Today, update 1.15 for Elevation SRS has been released. This update introduces a plethora of tweaks and
                bug fixes as well as a few new features. Users and operators are now able to receive text message notifications
                for work order updates, which can be enabled or disabled from the account settings. In addition, users can
                now attach up to 5 files to each work order, and the maximum file attachment size has been increased from 5 MB
                to 10 MB. For a full list of changes, please consult the changelog.</p>

                <h2>What Elevation SRS Has Accomplished In A Year</h2>
                <time>September 20, 2019</time>
                <p>Today marks the first anniversary since Elevation SRS officially launched. So much has happened since then,
                and there is so much to be grateful for (and so much to learn, too). Above all else, we are grateful for
                our loyal customers who have made our work possible. In less than a year, over 500 organizations switched
                to Elevation SRS &mdash; far more than we initially hoped for. We are humbled by such a strong reception,
                and we are thankful for all the helpful feedback we received. We have several important upgrades in the pipeline,
                and our inventory management system is scheduled to be released before the next anniversary (stay posted!).
                We look forward to another exciting year of helping our clients succeed!</p>
